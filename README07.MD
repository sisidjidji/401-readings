- The abstract keyword enables you to create classes and class members that are incomplete and must be implemented in a derived class.

- The sealed keyword enables you to prevent the inheritance of a class or certain class members that were previously marked virtual.

- Inheritance, together with encapsulation and polymorphism, is one of the three primary characteristics of object-oriented programming.

- Inheritance enables you to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior defined in other classes.

- Conceptually, a derived class is a specialization of the base class.

- When you define a class to derive from another class, the derived class implicitly gains all the members of the base class, except for its constructors and finalizers. The derived class reuses the code in the base class without having to reimplement it.
