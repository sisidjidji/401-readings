1. Data seeding is the process of populating a database with an initial set of data.

There are several ways this can be accomplished in EF Core:

- Model seed data
- Manual migration customization
- Custom initialization logic


2.  you can use context.Database.EnsureCreated() to create a new database containing the seed data, for example for a test database or when using the in-memory provider or any non-relation database. Note that if the database already exists, EnsureCreated() will neither update the schema nor seed data in the database. For relational databases you shouldn't call EnsureCreated() if you plan to use Migrations.

3. This type of seed data is managed by migrations and the script to update the data that's already in the database needs to be generated without connecting to the database. This imposes some restrictions:

The primary key value needs to be specified even if it's usually generated by the database. It will be used to detect data changes between migrations.
Previously seeded data will be removed if the primary key is changed in any way.


4. When a migration is added the changes to the data specified with HasData are transformed to calls to InsertData(), UpdateData(), and DeleteData(). One way of working around some of the limitations of HasData is to manually add these calls or custom operations to the migration instead.
