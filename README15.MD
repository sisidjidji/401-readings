## Binary Trees

- Common Terminology:
1. **Node** - A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structure
2. **Root** - The root is the first/top Node in the tree
3. **Left Child** - The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node
4. **Right Child** - The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node
5. **Edge** - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
6. **Leaf** - A leaf is a node that does not contain any children
7. **Height** - The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node


- Traversals

1. Depth First

Here are three methods for depth first traversal:

Pre-order: root >> left >> right
In-order: left >> root >> right
Post-order: left >> right >> root


2. Breadth First

Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node
