## 1.Why JSX?
React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will come back to components in a further section, but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you otherwise.

React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.

## 2. Updating the Rendered Element
React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.

With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to ReactDOM.render().


## 3. Components 
 Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components. 

 ## 4. Converting a Function to a Class

You can convert a function component like Clock to a class in five steps:

* Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends React.Component.
* Add a single empty method to it called render().
* Move the body of the function into the render() method.
* Replace props with this.props in the render() body.
* Delete the remaining empty function declaration.
