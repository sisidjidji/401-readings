Routing
Using react-router, you can easily toggle the visibility of components (or even pages) based on the URL/Route that the user engages with.

import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';

To use Browser Router properly, you eliminate your use of <a> tags and instead use it’s built-in <Link> component.

< Link to="/">Home</Link>
< Link to="/stuff">Stuff</Link>
In practice, then, use the router component to look at either / or /stuff and based on that, displaying either the Home or the List component…

 < Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
< Route exact path="/stuff" render={() => <List>{items}</List>} />
Component Composition - Logical
In this setup, you are sending your child components the raw data and allowing them to render the output as they decide.


// Dashboard Wrapper
//  - feeds the SearchForm some methods
//  - then feeds the results some data

< Dashboard >
  < SearchForm handler={this.doTheSearch} / >
  < Results data={this.state.results} />
< /Dashboard>

// .. Results Component
< ul>
  {this.props.data.map( (item,i) => < li key={i}>{item}< /li> );
< /ul>

Component Composition - Using Logic-less Children
This is typically used when your children are already in JSX form (pre-rendered) and you need to display them as a whole. A good example might be a gallery of images

< Dashboard>
  render() {
    let listings = {this.state.results.map( (item,i) => <li key={i}>{item}</li> );
  }
  < SearchForm handler={this.doTheSearch} />
  < Results>
    { listings.map( listing => listing ) }
  < /Results>
< /Dashboard>

// Results Component

< ul>
  {this.props.children}
< /ul>
